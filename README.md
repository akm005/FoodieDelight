# FOODIEDELIGHT Frontend

## Overview

FOODIEDELIGHT is a food delivery application that allows restaurant admins to manage their listings. This repository contains the frontend implementation for the application, developed using Angular. 

## Project Details

As a full-stack developer, I would have preferred to create both the frontend and backend for a complete end-to-end solution. However, due to time constraints, only the frontend component has been submitted.

The project was completed in approximately 2 days. Below is a breakdown of the time spent:

- **Frontend Functionality**: 12-15 hours
- **Frontend Presentational Aspects**: 6-8 hours
- **Required Validations**: 2-3 hours
- **Unit Test Coverage**: Not implemented due to time constraints
- **Deployment**: 1-2 hours

**Total Time Spent**: Approximately 21-28 hours.

## Features Implemented

- **Image Optimization**: Improved performance by optimizing images.
- **Skeleton Loader**: Enhanced user experience with a skeleton loader during data fetches.
- **Pagination**: Implemented pagination for efficient data management.
- **Login and Demo User Selector**: Added functionality for user login and selection of demo users.
- **Remember Last URL**: Maintains the last accessed URL when editing without being logged in.
- **Responsive Side Panel**: Designed a side panel for better navigation on mobile devices.
- **Guards, Pipes, and Validators**: Implemented for better data handling and validation.
- **Authenticated Pages**: Ensured secure access to authenticated pages.
- **State Management**: Utilized Angular services for state management.
